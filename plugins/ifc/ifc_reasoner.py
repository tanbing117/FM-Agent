"""IFC reasoner — deterministic lattice evaluation over LLM-derived flow signatures.

Split of responsibility (per Oracle consult, docs/ifc_design.md):
  - The LLM derives a PARAMETRIC flow signature (ifc_prompts.derive_flow_signature):
    which input sources each output channel depends on, plus inferred input labels
    and proposed declassifications. The LLM is good at "what depends on what",
    including implicit flows.
  - THIS module makes the security decision deterministically and fail-closed:
    it evaluates each output channel's label by joining the labels of its
    dependency sources, then classifies the function.

Two-level lattice: Low < High. join(High, anything) = High.

Verdict per function:
  - LEAK         : a Low-observable channel is High due to a GENUINE source
                   (a parameter labelled High by policy/naming, a High global, or
                   const:High) and is not declassified.
  - DECLASSIFIED : the High->Low flow(s) are covered by an anchored declassification
                   proposal (human review required).
  - POLYMORPHIC  : a Low-observable channel is High ONLY because of an Unknown-
                   labelled PARAMETER. Whether this is a real leak depends on the
                   caller's actual argument, so it cannot be judged in isolation;
                   it is resolved at call sites via instantiate_callee(). This is
                   why pure pass-throughs like identity(x) are not false LEAKs.
  - SECURE       : all Low-observable channels are Low.
  - ERROR        : no valid signature (fail-closed: never silently SECURE).

Cross-function (assume-guarantee, change-point B):
  A callee signature is parametric. At a call site the caller instantiates it by
  substituting the actual argument labels for the callee's formal-parameter
  sources -- see instantiate_callee(). A parameter's label in isolation is an
  ASSUMPTION, not a fact: the only caller-independent ("genuine") High sources are
  const:High channels, High globals, and parameters the policy labels High by name.
