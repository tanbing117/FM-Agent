    )
    return (
        lang_expertise
        + "You are performing static INFORMATION FLOW CONTROL (IFC) analysis with a "
        "two-level lattice: High (secret/sensitive) and Low (public/observable). "
        "Non-interference requires that Low-observable outputs must not depend on High inputs.\n\n"
        "Your job is to derive a PARAMETRIC FLOW SIGNATURE for one function: for each "
        "output channel, the SET of input sources whose values it depends on — including "
        "IMPLICIT flows (a value assigned or an effect performed under a branch/loop/early-"
        "return/exception whose guard depends on an input also depends on that input).\n\n"
        "CRITICAL rules:\n"
        "1. Dependencies are PARAMETRIC: list the input SOURCES (param:<name>, global:<name>, "
        "receiver.<attr>), NOT a hard High/Low. A pass-through like identity(x) has return depends "
        "on {param:x} regardless of whether x happens to be secret.\n"
        "2. RECEIVER ATTRIBUTES ARE PER-ATTRIBUTE, NOT ONE BLOB. When a method reads instance "
        "attributes via `self`/`this`, treat EACH accessed attribute as its OWN distinct source "
        "named `receiver.<attr>` (e.g. `self.client_secret` -> `receiver.client_secret`, "
        "`self.base_url` -> `receiver.base_url`). NEVER collapse them into a single `receiver` "
        "source, and NEVER let one secret attribute taint the whole receiver. Label each "
        "`receiver.<attr>` independently: `receiver.client_secret` is High, but `receiver.base_url` "
        "or `receiver.timeout` is Low. An output depends only on the SPECIFIC attributes it "
        "actually reads, not on `self` as a whole.\n"
        "3. CONTAINER FIELD ACCESS IS PER-FIELD. When a value is extracted from a "
        "parameter/global/receiver by a NAMED field or key (e.g. `request.get(\"password\")`, "
        "`params[\"token\"]`, `body.api_key`, `config.db_password`), treat that extracted value as "
        "its OWN source named `<container>.<field>` (e.g. `param:request.password`, "
        "`param:body.api_key`) and label it by the FIELD name, NOT the container. A Low container "
        "(like a generic `request`/`params`/`body`) can still yield a High field: "
        "`request.get(\"password\")` is `param:request.password` = High even though `request` "
        "itself is Low. Never let a Low container mask a sensitive field, and never let one "
        "sensitive field taint the whole container. If a flow's notes describe a secret field "
        "reaching a sink, the structured `deps` MUST list that field source.\n"
        "4. Capture IMPLICIT flows. If `if (secret) out=1 else out=0`, then return depends on "
        "{the guard's sources}. If a value is written under a High-dependent branch, it depends "
        "on the guard. break/continue/return/throw under a guard taint the affected channel.\n"
        "5. INFER an initial label (High/Low) for each input source from naming "
        "conventions (password/secret/token/key/hash/ssn/credential => High; "
        "id/name/url/host/port/path/timeout/count/index/flag => Low), types, and any provided "
        "domain context. When genuinely unsure, mark it \"Unknown\" (the checker treats Unknown "
        "as High, fail-closed). Do NOT guess Low to be lenient, but DO label clearly-public "
        "fields (urls, hosts, public ids, timeouts, counts) as Low.\n"
        "6. DECLASSIFICATION: if a High->Low flow is INTENTIONAL and semantically necessary "
        "(e.g. password check returning a 1-bit match result, publishing a one-way hash), record "
        "it under \"declassifications\" with an anchor (the exact statement) and a reason. Do NOT "
        "use declassification to excuse releasing a full secret value. A declassification is a "
        "PROPOSAL for human review, not a pass.\n"
        "7. EXTERNAL OBSERVABILITY IS PER SINK. Every output must include `sink_channel` "
        "and `observability`. Use observability `external` only when an unauthorized actor, "
        "API/UI/CLI client, stdout consumer, or public network peer can see it; use `internal` "
        "for trusted operator telemetry; use `caller` for a return/raised value whose eventual "
        "visibility depends on the caller. A caught exception is not safe if its detail reaches "
        "an external message. Conversely, detailed internal exception logging alone is not a "
        "public leak. Analyze simultaneous sinks independently.\n"
        "8. ERROR CONTENT IS DISTINCT FROM ERROR CONTROL. `exception` describes whether an "
        "error occurs; `exception:message` or `error:<destination>` describes error text/data. "
        "A generic external error plus a detailed internal log has no High dependency on the "
        "external sink. Do not transfer the internal log's detail to the generic response.\n"
        "9. FOLLOW NESTED SECRET FIELDS THROUGH CONTAINER MUTATION. If a generic options/params "
        "container can contain a password, token, private key, or another secret and is merged after "
        "normal redaction/no-log registration, model the nested field as High and include the "
        "downstream log/stdout/serialized invocation sinks only when the source or callee context "
        "contains that path. A merge alone is not evidence of a sink. A fail-closed rejection before "
        "the merge blocks that secret flow.\n"
